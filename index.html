With more than 3 years of work experience in AI, I have a strong understanding of AI technology and its application in various industrial sectors.
                                                                </p>

								<h2>Activities and Hobbies</h2>

                                                                <p style="text-align:justify">

I am passionate about continuously learning the latest developments in Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, such as Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN). I often read articles and scientific journals to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and innovations in the tech world.
                                                                    <br><br>

                                                                    <br><br>

I have worked on several projects using stable diffusion and focused on developing code that can run on edge computing with fast and efficient inference. These projects often involve using Computer Vision techniques for object detection and classification with advanced algorithms like <b><i><a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/wayandadang/yolov9-object-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YOLO.</a></i></b>
                                                                    <br><br>
                                                                    In my leisure time, I enjoy reading books, writing articles in <b><i><a href="https://medium.com/@wayandadangunsri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a></i></b>, and fishing. These activities help me relax and provide a balance to my tech-focused endeavors.
                                                                    <br><br>
                                                                    Finally, with a holistic approach to technology, I am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skills through personal and collaborative projects. My deep interest in technology not only enriches my knowledge but also gives me satisfaction in creating innovative and effective solutions.

								<h2 class="minor">Face Tracking Using cvzone and PID Control with Arduino Servo Motors</h2>
									<p>This project is designed for the purpose of tracking a person's face using the cvzone library, which is developed from the mediapipe library. To ensure the accuracy of the coordinate positions, a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) algorithm is added. As for the Arduino code, PID is also used to control the servos more accurately and is combined with an exponential filter. This filter smooths the position data before it is applied to the servos. FilteredX and filteredY are the filtered positions.

								<h2 class="minor">Security System Using A Robot Based on Speech Recognition</h2>
								<p>Presented at the 2019 International Conference on Information System & Technology, STMIK AKAKOM Yogyakarta, December 5-6, 2019, Yogyakarta, this paper introduces an innovative security system utilizing a robot controlled via speech recognition technology. The system employs Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to accurately recognize and process voice commands, enabling users to interact with the robot through natural language for efficient and intuitive control. The integration of GMM ensures robust and reliable speech recognition, enhancing the system's effectiveness in real-world security scenarios. This study highlights the potential of combining robotics with advanced speech recognition techniques to create sophisticated, user-friendly security solutions.</p>

									<li>A final thesis project related to AI for Security System and Robotics</li>
									<li>This topic was presented in a series of events at the <a href="https://isriti.utdi.ac.id/" style="color: aqua;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 2nd INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON RESEARCH OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (ISRITI)</a></li>
									<li>This study describes a security system using a humanoid robot by utilizing speech recognition. The robot has two main parts, namely, Raspberry Pi 3 and two Arduino UNO R3 as a slave. This robot is designed as a combination of speech recognition and voice biometric. The instruction given by a speaker must be obeyed by the robot using servo motor. Meanwhile, for voice biometric, robot may give access to an authorized person using speech recognition. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), their delta, and delta-delta are used as feature extraction which is fed to a classifier, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Results of this study show that the robot may recognize the speaker with an accuracy of 99.4% and 99% for 50% of testing data and 20% of testing data, respectively. Thus, this suggests that the combination of MFCC and GMM can be implemented in speech recognition for security system performed by the robot.</li>

															<h3>Kontes Robot Line Follower - Sumatra Selatan 2014 di Acara Gebyar Elektro Sriwijaya</h3>
															<p>The line follower robot competition is like the "Hello World" of the robotics world. It's one of the most basic and popular challenges for beginners to start their journey in robotics. In this competition, robots must follow a predetermined line on the surface, using sensors to detect the path and simple algorithms to control their movements. Although the concept is simple, this competition teaches many fundamental principles of robotics, such as sensing, actuation, and control programming. Therefore, many schools and robotics clubs use the line follower robot competition as an initial project to introduce students to the broader world of technology and engineering.</p>

								<h3>Abstract</h3>
										<p>
											This study describes a security system using a humanoid robot by utilizing speech recognition. The robot has two main parts, namely, Raspberry Pi 3 and two Arduino UNO R3 as a slave. This robot is designed as a combination of speech recognition and voice biometric. The instruction given by a speaker must be obeyed by the robot using servo motor. Meanwhile, for voice biometric, the robot may give access to an authorized person using speech recognition. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), their delta, and delta-delta are used as feature extraction which is fed to a classifier, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Results of this study show that the robot may recognize the speaker with an accuracy of 99.4% and 99% for 50% of testing data and 20% of testing data, respectively. Thus, this suggests that the combination of MFCC and GMM can be implemented in speech recognition for security system performed by the robot.

										<p>
											Space travel is long, time-consuming, and costly. Only certain institutions with substantial capital and funds can build rockets to send satellites and other space objects into space. Rocket launches are often conducted by international space agencies such as NASA (the American space agency), ESA (the European Space Agency), SpaceX (owned by Elon Musk), JAXA (the Japanese space agency), and other space agencies. Each space journey requires a large amount of fuel, which is very heavy. This is why rockets are designed with large dimensions, as much of the rocket's space is used to store fuel.

										<p>
											The problem of future energy scarcity must be addressed as early as possible, considering that fossil energy reserves are depleting year by year. We cannot rely on fossil energy as the main energy source forever. Electricity has become a basic necessity for modern life, whether for industrialization processes, the economy, or development processes, because without electricity, these activities cannot be carried out properly or may not be possible at all.
